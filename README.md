# Battle of Neighborhoods in New York City: Opening a Pizza Place  
## Introduction  
New York City is the most populated city in the United States. It is a diverse city that attracts lots of Bussinesses each year.
One of the most popular bussinesses in NYC is restaurant. There are enough restaurants in NYC that you can eat for 23
years without eating in a restaurant twice. The large number of restaurants doesn't mean that all of them are successful. To
thrive in such an environment, you need to do intensive study before openning one. Let's assume that we want to add a
Italian Restaurant to the pile of restaurants in NYC. We would like to know where is the best place to open it.<br>

We will use the dataset of the neighborhoods and boroughs in NYC and an API from Foursquare to access the amenities in each neighborhood to analyze the neighborhoods and find the best neighborhood for opening a new pizza parlor.
